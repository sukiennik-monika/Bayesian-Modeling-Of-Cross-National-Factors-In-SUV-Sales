# Bayesian-Modeling-Of-Cross-National-Factors-In-SUV-Sales

This repository contains the code and data for the project "Multilevel hierarchical Bayesian modeling of cross-national factors in SUV sales". The project aims to analyze and model the factors influencing SUV sales across different countries using Bayesian statistical methods.

## Introduction

Understanding the determinants of SUV sales in various countries is essential for automotive manufacturers and marketers. This project leverages Bayesian modeling to analyze cross-national data on SUV sales, providing insights into the relationships between national factors and SUV sales. Bayesian methods offer a probabilistic framework that incorporates prior knowledge.

## Files

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks used for modeling and analysis.

- `first_model.ipynb`: Initial Bayesian model development and analysis.
- `second_model.ipynb`: Refinement and extension of the initial model.
- `third_model.ipynb`: Further model iterations and improvements.
- `fourth_model.ipynb`: Final model adjustments and evaluation.
- `model_comparison.ipynb`: Comparative analysis of different models.
